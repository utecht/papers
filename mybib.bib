@article{Fielding2000,
abstract = {The World Wide Web has succeeded in the large part because its
software architecture has been designed to meet the needs of an
Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system. The modern Web
architecture emphasizes scalability of component interactions,
generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and
intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security,
and encapsulate legacy systems. We introduce the Representational State
Transfer (REST) architectural style, developed as an abstract model of
the Web architecture to guide our redesign and definition of the
Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifiers. We
describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the
interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting
them to the constraints of other architectural styles. We then compare
the abstract model to the currently deployed Web architecture in order
to elicit mismatches between the existing protocols and the applications
they are intended to support},

abstract = {Semantic Web technologies must integrate with Web 2.0 services for both to leverage each others strengths. We argue that the REST-based design methodologies [R.T. Fielding, R.N. Taylor, Principled design of the modern web architecture, ACM Trans. Internet Technol. (TOIT) 2 (2) (2002) 115–150] of the web present the ideal mechanism through which to align the publication of semantic data with the existing web architecture. We present the design and implementation of two solutions that combine REST-based design and RDF [D. Beckett (Ed.), RDF/XML Syntax Specification (Revised), W3C Recommendation, February 10, 2004] data access: one solution for integrating existing web services and one server-side solution for creating RDF REST services. Both of these solutions enable SPARQL [E. Prud’hommeaux, A. Seaborne (Eds.), SPARQL Query Language for RDF, W3C Working Draft, March 26, 2007] to be a unifying data access layer for aligning the Semantic Web and Web 2.0.},

abstract = {We describe our method for benchmarking Semantic Web knowledge base systems with respect to use in large OWL applications. We present the Lehigh University Benchmark (LUBM) as an example of how to design such benchmarks. The LUBM features an ontology for the university domain, synthetic OWL data scalable to an arbitrary size, 14 extensional queries representing a variety of properties, and several performance metrics. The LUBM can be used to evaluate systems with different reasoning capabilities and storage mechanisms. We demonstrate this with an evaluation of two memory-based systems and two systems with persistent storage. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@phdthesis{Galletta2002,
abstract = {Although its popularity is widespread, the Web is well known for one particular drawback: its frequent delay when moving from one page to another. This experimental study examined whether delay and two other website design variables (site breadth and content familiarity) have interaction effects on user performance, attitudes, and behavioral intentions. The three experimental factors (delay, familiarity, and breadth) collectively impact the cognitive costs and penalties that users incur when making choices in their search for target information. An experiment was conducted with 160 undergraduate business majors in a completely counterbalanced, fully factorial design that exposed them to two websites and asked them to browse the sites for nine pieces of information. Results showed that all three factors have strong direct impacts on performance and user attitudes, in turn affecting behavioral intentions to return to the site, as might be expected. A significant three-way interaction was found between all three factors indicating that these factors not only individually impact a user’s experiences with a website, but also act in combination to either increase or decrease the costs a user incurs. Two separate analyses support an assertion that attitudes mediate the relationship of the three factors on behavioral intentions. The implications of these results for both researchers and practitioners are discussed. Additional research is needed to discover other factors that mitigate or accentuate the effects of delay, other effects of delay, and under what amounts of delay these effects occur.},
