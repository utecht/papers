@article{Fielding2000,
abstract = {The World Wide Web has succeeded in the large part because its
software architecture has been designed to meet the needs of an
Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system. The modern Web
architecture emphasizes scalability of component interactions,
generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and
intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security,
and encapsulate legacy systems. We introduce the Representational State
Transfer (REST) architectural style, developed as an abstract model of
the Web architecture to guide our redesign and definition of the
Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifiers. We
describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the
interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting
them to the constraints of other architectural styles. We then compare
the abstract model to the currently deployed Web architecture in order
to elicit mismatches between the existing protocols and the applications
they are intended to support},

abstract = {Semantic Web technologies must integrate with Web 2.0 services for both to leverage each others strengths. We argue that the REST-based design methodologies [R.T. Fielding, R.N. Taylor, Principled design of the modern web architecture, ACM Trans. Internet Technol. (TOIT) 2 (2) (2002) 115–150] of the web present the ideal mechanism through which to align the publication of semantic data with the existing web architecture. We present the design and implementation of two solutions that combine REST-based design and RDF [D. Beckett (Ed.), RDF/XML Syntax Specification (Revised), W3C Recommendation, February 10, 2004] data access: one solution for integrating existing web services and one server-side solution for creating RDF REST services. Both of these solutions enable SPARQL [E. Prud’hommeaux, A. Seaborne (Eds.), SPARQL Query Language for RDF, W3C Working Draft, March 26, 2007] to be a unifying data access layer for aligning the Semantic Web and Web 2.0.},
